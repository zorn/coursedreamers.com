My name is Michael Zornek ([personal website](https://mikezornek.com/)), and I am a developer and teacher from the suburbs of Philadelphia, PA.

Course Dreamers is a new blog where I share my research, observations, and links regarding the work of programmers and technically-minded folks building online courses, some for the first time.

I have taught in various forms across my career, including onsite corporate workshops for iOS development (at Amazon, Google, and TripAdvisor) and as an adjust professor at Drexel University teaching modern web design (for the time, back in 2004).

Teaching and building courses can be an extremely rewarding extension of your programming career -- but it's a challenging skill like any other. Course Dreamer aims to help you on that path to producing loved and successful courses for your students.
