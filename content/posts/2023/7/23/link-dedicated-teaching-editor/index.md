Joe Previte [shares an article](https://coder.com/blog/dedicated-development-environment-for-teaching) about how he sets up an on-demand dedicated teaching code editor experience using Coder.

> As a software instructor, it's a pain managing two sets of VS Code and terminal settings. I have one for everyday and one for teaching. The worst thing is finding out I used the wrong settings after recording a 3-hour course. I decided to fix this by using a dedicated development environment for teaching.

I highly recommend having a simplified editor presentation for recordings to help keep the student focused. I generally have just hid UI manually before a recording but I like the idea of a dedicated setup. He mentions the pain of multiple VS Code settings but I wonder how true that is. Anyways, good post and some good linked resources.
