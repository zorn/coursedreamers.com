> One of the best decisions ever was to create a Discord server for my video course "Build an MVP with Elixir". Now, students can get immediate support and I get to learn which parts of the course are tricky or contain errors. It's a great feedback loop and a win-win for everybody!

Peter distributes his course as a [simple Gumroad asset download](https://pjullrich.gumroad.com/l/bmvp) purchase so I think the optional Discord for students is a great addition to help connect and understand what struggles they run into.

Making sure you have signals in a feedback loop to truly understand how successful your students are is extremely important to crafting successful courses.
